    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
<p>What do you hope to learn in your html/css course?</p>
<p> I would like to be able to understand the basic structure of a HTML document, code elements, attributes and tags.</p>
<p> Gaining knowledge on how to format a web page using CSS is a basic concept necessary for me to learn, and advance in web design.  </p>
<p> Knowlede in both HTML/CSS is key for me to move on to links, lists, and navigation menus.</p>
